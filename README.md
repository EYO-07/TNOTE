# TNOTE (Windows 10,+)
Hi, I'm oZumbiAnalitico, an amateur programmer. This is one of my first experiences using A.I. to program something simple using the windows.h library.

[ TNOTE ] : Minimalist Translucent Notepad
1. The TNOTE was designed to interpret simple commands which can be used to set properties. For example, write @{400,400} and press F1 to execute command to resize the application.
2. Double-Click to alternate between compact and full mode.
3. I used microsoft copilot, you can see the full conversation [here]( https://copilot.microsoft.com/shares/HDmaQzPo52moAgq5tUHab )

## Commands
1. @exit ; Exit the application
2. @load ; Load a file
3. @{X,Y} ; X width and Y height
4. ctrl+s ; Save the File
5. @{font:X} ; X font size
6. @compact ; set compact mode true
7. @-compact ; set compact mode false
8. @shrink ; set shrink mode true (when the program loses focus they will change size)
9. @-shrink ; ...
10. alt+arrow_key ; move the application
